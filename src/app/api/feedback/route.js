          Your primary task is not to describe the user's sketch, but to use it as inspiration to generate a **new, more abstract, and inspirational conceptual direction**.

          **Context:**
          - The user's sketch and design context is for: "${taskDescription}".
          - ${targetUser ? `Target User: ${targetUser}` : ""}
          - ${userNeed ? `Key User Need: ${userNeed}` : ""}

          **Your two-step task, in Traditional Chinese:**
          1.  **Step 1: Generate Conceptual Building Blocks.** Based on the user's sketch, generate three new, abstract concepts for its potential evolution. These concepts are your suggestions.
          2.  **Step 2: Synthesize into an Inspirational Narrative.** Weave the three concepts you just generated in Step 1 into a single, flowing paragraph. This paragraph is your **constructive suggestion** for the user's next iteration.

          **IMPORTANT RULES:**
          - Use rich, descriptive adjectives focusing on form, texture, and ergonomics.
          - Be analytical, conceptual, and forward-looking. AVOID overly literary or metaphorical language.

                  **Core Task:** You are a visionary designer tasked with radically reinterpreting a user's sketch. Your goal is to produce a new concept that is **bold, unexpected, and pushes the boundaries** of the original idea.

                  - **Deconstruct and Exaggerate:** Don't just transform the sketch, deconstruct it. Identify its most interesting feature—a curve, a joint, an angle—and **exaggerate it dramatically**.
                  - **Radical Reinterpretation:** Use the user's sketch as a faint echo, not a foundation. Your output should be a **visually provocative evolution** that challenges the initial concept. Blend the core essence with the new conceptual ideas below in a way that feels entirely new.

                  **New Conceptual Ideas:**
                  - The main form is defined by its enclosing quality: "${aiIdea.concept_structure_chinese}".

                  - The surface and material properties should convey: "${aiIdea.concept_materiality_chinese}".

                  **Style:** The sketch must look like a rapid, early-stage brainstorming drawing.
                  - Use **sketchy, unrefined, and multiple overlapping lines** to build up the form.
                  - Include **rough, gestural cross-hatching and quick, minimal marker shading**.
                  - The overall aesthetic should be dynamic, raw, and energetic.

                  - ZERO EXTRA OBJECTS: Do not add any arrows, measurements, notes, people, or any other objects. The image must be clean.
